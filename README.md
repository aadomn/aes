# Fixsliced AES-128 implementations

This repository contains efficient constant-time implementations for the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm as supplementary material for the paper [Fixslicing AES-like Ciphers - New bitsliced AES speed records on ARM Cortex-M and RISC-V](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/412.pdf) pulished at [TCHES 2020-1](https://tches.iacr.org/index.php/TCHES/issue/archive).
